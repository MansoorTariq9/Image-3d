# HSI Gaussian 3D Project - Complete Conversation Log

## Project Overview
Client wants to adapt GaussianAnything for 3D reconstruction of hyperspectral images (HSI), similar to HS-NeRF capabilities.

## Client's Initial Requirements
- Trying to do 3D reconstruction of HSI images
- Reference: https://gchenfc.github.io/hs-nerf-website/#Depth
- Want to adapt: https://nirvanalan.github.io/projects/GA/
- Has HSI data to share

## Client's Data Specifications
- **120 spectral channels** (covering 400-1000nm wavelength range)
- **Resolution**: 332×324 (width × height)
- **Factory calibration** already applied
- **NO white/dark reference images** for calibration
- Plans to follow Neural Field approach (background = 1.0)

## ENVI Data Format (Provided by client)
```
wavelength = {400.00, 405.04, 410.08, ..., 1000.00}  # 120 bands
samples = 332
lines = 324
bands = 120
data type = 4  # float32
interleave = bsq  # band sequential
header offset = 67
byte order = 0
```

## Key Technical Insights

### From HS-NeRF:
- Uses 128 spectral channels (we adapt to 120)
- Wavelength-dependent radiance modeling
- Depth estimation from reconstruction
- No explicit loss functions specified

### From GaussianAnything:
- Input: RGB-D-Normal (6 channels)
- VAE + DiT architecture
- Two-stage generation: layout then texture
- Cross-attention for multi-view
- Point cloud structured latent space

### Our Novel Approach:
- **Each Gaussian stores 120 spectral values** (not just RGB)
- Modified VAE: 120→64→32→16 channel compression
- No calibration required (percentile normalization)
- Explicit depth network (unlike HS-NeRF's implicit)
- Custom losses: MSE + SAM + depth + KL + smoothness

## Client's Additional Input
1. **SuperGlue suggestion**: "COLMAP didn't work well if you will use to estimate the depth map. https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization/tree/master, superglue is better"
   - Client is right - COLMAP struggles with spectral variations
   - SuperGlue's learned features handle wavelength shifts better

2. **Timeline request**: "How much time it will take? What is your availability? Can you send detailed diagrams?"

3. **Urgent deadline**: "Is it possible to get something done by next Wednesday?"

## Implementation Status
Created complete implementation with:
- `core/spectral_gaussian.py` - 3D Gaussians with 120 spectral channels
- `core/hsi_vae.py` - VAE adapted for HSI input
- `core/spectral_renderer.py` - Wavelength-dependent rendering
- `core/depth_estimator.py` - Depth from spectral signatures
- `data/preprocessing.py` - Handles uncalibrated HSI
- `train.py` - Complete training pipeline
- `inference.py` - Testing and visualization

## Proposed Timeline
**MVP by Wednesday (6 days)**: 40-50 hours
- Basic 3D reconstruction
- Initial visualizations
- Depth maps

**Full implementation**: 160 hours (4 weeks)
- Complete optimization
- Documentation
- Production ready

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Data Preprocessing:
- Background estimation using 95th percentile
- Percentile normalization (2-98%) per channel
- Spectral smoothing (3-channel moving average)

### VAE Modifications:
- Spectral encoder: 120→64→32→16 channels
- Spatial encoder with 4x downsampling
- Cross-attention for multi-view fusion
- Output: 512D latent + 2048 3D points

### Gaussian Model:
- 50,000 Gaussians
- Each stores: [x,y,z,rotation,scale,opacity,spectrum[120]]
- Spectral smoothness regularization
- Wavelength interpolation

### Rendering:
- Gaussian splatting adapted for spectra
- Render at any wavelength via interpolation
- Real-time after training

### Loss Functions:
- L_MSE: Standard reconstruction
- L_SAM: Spectral Angle Mapper (illumination invariant)
- L_depth: Consistency with estimated depth
- L_KL: VAE regularization
- L_smooth: Spectral smoothness
- Weights: λ₁=1.0, λ₂=0.1, λ₃=0.1, λ₄=0.001, λ₅=0.01

## Files Created
1. Core implementation modules
2. Training/inference scripts
3. Configuration files
4. Multiple flowcharts and diagrams
5. Client communication drafts
6. Test verification scripts

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. Integrate SuperGlue for pose estimation
2. Create ENVI data loader
3. Start with basic reconstruction
4. Prepare MVP for Wednesday deadline

## Important Notes
- Client emphasized SuperGlue over COLMAP
- Wavelength spacing is exactly 5.04nm
- Background = 1.0 approach (from Neural Fields)
- No calibration references available
- Urgent Wednesday deadline for initial results
