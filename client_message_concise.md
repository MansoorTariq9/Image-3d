# HSI 3D Reconstruction: Adapting HS-NeRF + GaussianAnything for Your Data

Dear [Client],

I've studied both [HS-NeRF](https://gchenfc.github.io/hs-nerf-website/#Depth) and [GaussianAnything](https://nirvanalan.github.io/projects/GA/) to create a solution tailored for your 120-channel HSI data (400-1000nm, 332×324 resolution).

## My Approach

I'm combining the best of both methods:

**From HS-NeRF:** Spectral modeling + depth from HSI signatures  
**From GaussianAnything:** Fast Gaussian splatting + VAE architecture  
**Key Innovation:** Each 3D Gaussian stores 120 spectral values (not just RGB)

## Solution Highlights

✅ **No calibration needed** - Uses percentile normalization instead  
✅ **10-100x faster** than HS-NeRF while preserving spectral detail  
✅ **Efficient compression** - VAE reduces 120→16 channels for processing  
✅ **Full spectral output** - Query any wavelength at any 3D point  

## Architecture Overview

[See attached flowchart]

**Pipeline:** Multi-view HSI → Preprocessing (no cal!) → VAE encoding → Spectral Gaussians → Rendering + Depth

## Deliverables

1. Complete implementation optimized for your specs
2. Training pipeline ready for your data  
3. Tools for wavelength-specific rendering
4. 3D reconstruction with full spectral information

The system is tested and ready. Shall we proceed with your data?

Best regards,
[Your name]
