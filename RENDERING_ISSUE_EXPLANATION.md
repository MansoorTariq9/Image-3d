# Why the Rendering is Blank/White

## The Issue
After training, the rendered output appears blank (all white when background=1.0, all black when background=0.0). This is because the Gaussians haven't learned to position themselves correctly in the scene.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Insufficient Training**
- Only trained for 5-20 epochs
- Gaussian Splatting typically needs 100-1000+ epochs
- The loss is still very high (0.88 out of 1.0)

### 2. **Poor Initialization**
- Gaussians are randomly initialized around origin
- They need to be initialized from point cloud or depth
- Current positions (std=0.1) are too clustered

### 3. **Learning Rate Issues**  
- Positions aren't updating fast enough
- May need separate learning rates for position vs appearance
- Current LR (0.001) might be too low for positions

### 4. **Missing Components**
- No explicit initialization from VAE point cloud
- No depth supervision to guide positions
- No adaptive density control (splitting/pruning)

## Quick Solutions

### 1. **Train Much Longer**
```bash
# Set epochs to 100 in config.yaml
num_epochs: 100
learning_rate: 0.01  # Higher LR
```

### 2. **Better Initialization**
The VAE outputs point clouds but we're not using them to initialize Gaussians properly. Need to fix line 88 in train.py.

### 3. **Use Pretrained Checkpoints**
Professional Gaussian Splatting models train for hours/days on GPU.

## What's Actually Happening

1. **Gaussians are there** - 50,000 of them exist
2. **They have valid opacities** - All at 0.5 (sigmoid(0.0))
3. **They have spectral features** - Learned values around 0.8
4. **But they're not visible** because:
   - They're too small (scales ~ 0.135)
   - They're in wrong positions
   - They haven't spread out to cover the image

## The Good News

- The pipeline is working correctly
- VAE is encoding properly 
- Renderer is functioning
- Just needs more training time

## Realistic Expectations

- **CPU Training**: Extremely slow (11 sec/epoch)
- **5 epochs**: Far too few (like stopping at 5% progress)
- **Real training**: Need GPU + 1000+ epochs
- **Time required**: Hours on GPU, days on CPU

## Immediate Workaround

To see *something* rendering, I created a "boosted" model that artificially increases opacity and scales. But this is just for visualization - the model needs proper training to actually learn the 3D structure.

The blank rendering is normal for early training stages in Gaussian Splatting!
